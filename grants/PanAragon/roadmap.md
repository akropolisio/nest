# PanAragon Roadmap

This timeline is an estimation after the deployment of the funds for the Nest is confirmed. It is based on deliverables/milestones per month to keep our goals clear and stages well-defined.

## 1st month - Working on a Proof of Concept. Results: 
Development of the tech specification for AraDot Chain.

The AraDot will be based on OCEAN model (Off-Chain Event AggregatioN) and will use state channels to bridge Aragon tokens to AraDot. 

## 2nd month -system of offchain-voting and decision making - Using state channels and native Substrate smart contracts

## 3rd month -Oracle development for voting results transferring from AraDot to Aragon DAO. 
  
## 4th month- Adding the ability to work with any DAO
At the 1st stage (1-3 months) we take a test list of DAOs, that can work with our solution. 
In the next stage (this one mentioned above, month 4 - we "open" our solution to all DAOs. 

## 5th month - Refactoring, stabilization, launch of the public TestNet network
PoC full preparation within budget specified. 
The product can be packaged as a standalone box version in the future, but this is planned for stage 2 - within the framework of the Aragon Flock Grant.

## Future plans: 

## 6-8 month - Development of a proof-of-concept DSL (domain-specific language) that makes it possible to create a different voting logic within AraDot.

## 9-12 month - Stabilization and launch of the public Mainnet.
